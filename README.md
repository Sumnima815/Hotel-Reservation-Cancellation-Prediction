Hotel Reservations Cancellation Prediction predicts the possible reservations that are going to be cancelled by analyzing features and variables associated with the reservation.

# Context #

*  Predicts the likelihood of hotel reservations being canceled based on historical data.
* Utilizes machine learning to optimize room occupancy and improve revenue management.
* Analyzes features such as booking lead time, customer demographics, room type, and reservation 
 changes.
* Helps hotels make proactive decisions on overbooking and marketing strategies to reduce revenue loss.
